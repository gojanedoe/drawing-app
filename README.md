# Summary

*Draw This* is a random photo generator for practicing drawing. Royalty-free images are fetched from Wikimedia Commons through the use of their API. The current version includes the option of drawing people, architecture, or landscapes.

The app is made with React.js, React Router, Bootstrap, and Jest, with the API queries originally built and tested in Postman. It uses the Durstenfeld algorithm for randomly shuffling the images, and the fetched JSON data is cleaned using Regular Expressions.
